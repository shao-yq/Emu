/*
 * CALL procedure-name
 *
 * CALL activated an out-of-line procedure, saving information on
 * the stack to permit a RET (return) instruction in the procedure
 * to transfer control back to the instruction following the CALL.
 * The assembler generates a different type of CALL instruction
 * depending on whether the programmer has defined the procedure
 * name as NEAR or FAR. For control to return properly, the type of
 * CALL instruction must match the type of RET instruction that
 * exists from the procedure. (The potential for a mismatch exists
 * if the procedure and the CALL are contained in separately
 * assembled programs.) Different forms of the CALL instruction
 * allow the address of the target procedure to be obtained from the
 * instruction itself (direct CALL) or from a memory location or
 * register referenced by the instruction (indirect CALL). In the
 * following descriptions, bear in mind that the processor
 * automatically adjusts IP to point to the next instruction to be
 * executed before saving it on the stack.
 *
 * For an intrasegment direct CALL, SP (the stack pointer) is
 * decremented by two and IP is pushed onto the stack. The relative
 * displacement (up to Â±32k) of the target procedure from the CALL
 * instruction is then added to the instruction pointer. This form
 * of the CALL instruction is "self-relative" and is appropriate for
 * position independent (dynamically relocatable) routines in which
 * the CALL and its target are in the same segment and are moved
 * together.
 *
 * An intrasegment indirect CALL may be made through memory or
 * through a register. SP is decremented by two and IP is pushed
 * onto the stack. The offset of the target procedure is obtained
 * from the memory word or 16-bit general register referenced in the
 * instruction and replaces IP.
 *
 * For an intersegment direct CALL, SP is decremented by two, and CS
 * is pushed onto the stack. CS is replaced by the segment word
 * contained in the instruction. SP again is decremented by two. IP
 * is pushed onto the stack and is replaced by the offset word
 * contained in the instruction.
 *
 * For an intersegment indirect CALL (which only may be made through
 * memory), SP is decremented by two, and CS is pushed onto the
 * stack. CS is then replaced by the content of the second word of
 * the doubleword memory pointer referenced by the instruction. SP
 * again is decremented by two, and IP is pushed onto the stack and
 * is replaced by the content of the first word of the doubleword
 * pointer referenced by the instruction.
