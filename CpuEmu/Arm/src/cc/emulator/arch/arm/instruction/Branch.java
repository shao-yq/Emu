 *  Instruction Branch:

 *  B , BL
 *
 * 4.4 Branch and Branch with Link (B, BL)
 * The instruction is only executed if the condition is true. The various conditions are
 * defined Table 4-2: Condition code summary on page 4-5. The instruction encoding
 * is shown in Figure 4-3: Branch instructions, below.

 * | Condition | 1| 0| 1| L|                      Offset                                           |  Branch
 * |-----------|--+--+--+--+-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------
 * Condition field       Link bit
 *                       0 = Branch
 *                       1 = Branch with Link
 * 
 * Branch instructions contain a signed 2â€™s complement 24 bit offset. This is shifted left
 * two bits, sign extended to 32 bits, and added to the PC. The instruction can therefore
 * specify a branch of +/- 32Mbytes. The branch offset must take account of the prefetch
 * operation, which causes the PC to be 2 words (8 bytes) ahead of the current instruction.
 * Branches beyond +/- 32Mbytes must use an offset or absolute destination which has
 * been previously loaded into a register. In this case the PC should be manually saved in
 * R14 if a Branch with Link type operation is required.
 * 
 * 4.4.1 The link bit
 * Branch with Link (BL) writes the old PC into the link register (R14) of the current bank.
 * The PC value written into R14 is adjusted to allow for the prefetch, and contains the
 * address of the instruction following the branch and link instruction. Note that the CPSR
 * is not saved with the PC and R14[1:0] are always cleared.
 * To return from a routine called by Branch with Link use MOV PC,R14 if the link register
 * is still valid or LDM Rn!,{..PC} if the link register has been saved onto a stack pointed
 * to by Rn.
 * 4.4.2 Instruction cycle times
 * Branch and Branch with Link instructions take 2S + 1N incremental cycles, where S and
 * N are as defined in 6.2 Cycle Types on page 6-3.
 * 
 * 4.4.3 Assembler syntax
 * Items in {} are optional. Items in <> must be present.
 *    B{L}{cond} <expression>
 *    {L}         is used to request the Branch with Link form of the instruction.
 *                If absent, R14 will not be affected by the instruction.
 *    {cond}      is a two-character mnemonic as shown in Table 4-2:
 *                Condition code summary on page 4-5. If absent then AL (ALways) will be used.
 *    <expression> is the destination. The assembler calculates the offset.
 * 
 * 4.4.4 Examples
 * here   BAL here    ; assembles to 0xEAFFFFFE (note effect of PC offset).
 *        B there     ; Always condition used as default.
 *        CMP R1,#0   ; Compare R1 with zero and branch to fred if R1 was zero, otherwise continue
 *        BEQ fred    ; continue to next instruction.
 *        BL sub+ROM  ; Call subroutine at computed address.
 *        ADDS R1,#1  ; Add 1 to register 1, setting CPSR flags on the result then call subroutine if
 *        BLCC sub    ; the C flag is clear, which will be the case unless R1 held 0xFFFFFFFF.
 *
